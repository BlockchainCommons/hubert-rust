## Introduction

**Hubert** provides a distributed infrastructure for secure multiparty transactions, such as FROST threshold signature ceremonies, enabling participants to communicate bidirectionally with complete opacity to outsiders. By leveraging write-once distributed storage with cryptographic identifiers, Hubert creates a trustless coordination layer where parties can exchange encrypted messages without relying on centralized servers or exposing sensitive information to network observers.

## Primary Purpose

Hubert's main purpose is to facilitate **secure multiparty transactions** where:

- **Participants write once** using ARID (Apparently Random Identifier) keys
- **Messages contain ARIDs** for expected responses, enabling bidirectional communication
- **Complete opacity** to outsiders through end-to-end encryption (GSTP)
- **No central server** required for coordination
- **Trustless operation** using public distributed networks (BitTorrent DHT, IPFS)

**Example Use Case: FROST Signing Ceremony**
1. Coordinator publishes encrypted signing request with ARID for responses
2. Participants retrieve request, generate signature shares
3. Each participant publishes encrypted response at coordinator-specified ARID
4. Coordinator retrieves all responses and completes signature
5. Network observers see only GSTP envelopes (encrypted subject, sealed recipient assertions)
6. ARIDs are never exposed - shared privately via secure channels (Signal, QR codes, etc.)


## About the "Hubert" Name

Ted Nelson's Project Xanadu had its own playful jargon. The basic object that behaved like a "file" was called a **bert**—named after **Bertrand Russell**. And because geeks can't resist wordplay, there was also an **ernie**, the metered unit of billing in the publishing system.

Mark S. Miller, one of Xanadu's architects, later designed the **Club System** (early groundwork for his capability-security thinking), which modeled group permissions but still relied on identity-checked ACLs rather than pure capabilities. That historical thread matters because Hubert sits exactly where Xanadu's ideas were pointing, but finishes the job with cryptography.

So: **Hubert** is the **hub of berts**. In Xanadu terms, it's the rendezvous point where these file-like objects (and their successors) can meet, exchange sealed messages, and coordinate—without servers, accounts, or trusted intermediaries. It's a deliberate nod to Nelson's vocabulary and to the "clubs" lineage, reframed for an era where capability comes from math, not administrators.

There's also a second layer to the name. Cryptography uses a stock cast—**Alice**, **Bob**, **Carol**, et al.—to illustrate protocols. **Hubert** joins that dramatis personae as the sturdy switchboard operator in the background: the dropbox, dead-drop, and message hub that keeps multiparty ceremonies moving while revealing nothing but ciphertext to the outside world.

## Getting Started

### As a Command-Line Tool

Install `hubert` from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install hubert
```

Or install from source:

```bash
cd hubert
cargo install --path .
```

See the [CLI Manual](./docs/CLIManual.md) for detailed usage instructions.

### As a Rust Library

Add Hubert to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
hubert = "0.1.0"
bc-components = "^0.25.0"
bc-envelope = "^0.34.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
```

See the [API Manual](./docs/APIManual.md) for detailed usage instructions.


## Key Capabilities

### 1. Write-Once Distributed Storage

Hubert provides APIs for four storage backends, all using write-once semantics:

- **BitTorrent Mainline DHT**: Fast, lightweight, serverless (≤1 KB messages)
- **IPFS**: Large capacity, content-addressed (up to 10 MB messages)
- **Hybrid**: Automatic optimization by size, combining DHT speed with IPFS capacity
- **Server**: Centralized storage for testing and controlled deployments (configurable size limits)

The first three backends (DHT, IPFS, Hybrid) provide decentralized, trustless operation suitable for production use. The Server backend is designed for development, testing, and controlled environments where centralized coordination is acceptable.

Write-once semantics eliminate race conditions and ensure message immutability—once published, content cannot be modified or deleted by anyone, providing strong integrity guarantees.

### 2. Cryptographic Addressing (ARID)

All storage operations use ARIDs (Apparently Random Identifiers):

- **Deterministic**: Same ARID always maps to same storage location
- **Privacy-Preserving**: ARID never exposed publicly; only derived storage keys visible
- **Collision-Resistant**: 256-bit cryptographic strength
- **Capability-Based**: ARID holder can read; ARID creator can write (once)
- **Secure Distribution**: ARIDs shared via encrypted channels (GSTP, Signal, QR codes)

Participants generate ARIDs for their messages and embed ARIDs where they expect responses, creating a decentralized communication graph. Storage networks see only derived keys (via HKDF), never the ARIDs themselves.

### 3. End-to-End Encryption (GSTP)

Hubert is designed to work with GSTP (Gordian Sealed Transaction Protocol) messages:

- **Sender Authentication**: Cryptographic signatures prove message origin
- **Receiver Encryption**: Only intended recipients can decrypt content
- **Multi-Recipient**: Single message encrypted to multiple parties
- **Stateless Operation**: Encrypted State Continuations eliminate server-side sessions
- **Network Opacity**: Storage networks see only encrypted envelopes

With GSTP integration, even storage indirection is secured—when Hybrid storage uses references, the references themselves are encrypted to the same recipients as the payload.

### 4. Bidirectional Communication Pattern

Hubert enables request-response flows without direct connections:

**Requester Workflow:**
1. Generate response_arid for where responder should publish
2. Create request message containing response_arid (encrypted within GSTP)
3. Publish encrypted request at request_arid
4. Share request_arid with responder via secure channel (Signal, QR code, etc.)
5. Monitor response_arid for responder's reply

**Responder Workflow:**
1. Receive request_arid via secure channel
2. Retrieve GSTP envelope from storage (using derived key from request_arid)
3. Decrypt and process request (only if recipient)
4. Extract response_arid from decrypted request
5. Create encrypted response
6. Publish response at response_arid

This pattern supports complex multiparty protocols (threshold signatures, distributed key generation, secure voting) without requiring participants to be online simultaneously or maintain persistent connections.

### 5. Automatic Storage Optimization (Hybrid Mode)

The Hybrid storage backend automatically optimizes for size:

- **Small messages (≤1 KB)**: Stored directly in DHT for fast retrieval
- **Large messages (>1 KB)**: Reference stored in DHT, actual content in IPFS
- **Transparent indirection**: Applications use same API regardless of size
- **Secure references**: With GSTP, even references are encrypted to recipients

This enables applications to send compact control messages via DHT while supporting large payloads (key material, proofs, documents) via IPFS without changing code.

## Use Cases

### 1. FROST Threshold Signatures

Coordinate multi-party threshold signature ceremonies:
- Coordinator publishes signing request with participant ARIDs
- Participants publish signature shares at designated ARIDs
- Coordinator aggregates shares into final signature
- No trusted server required; all communication encrypted

### 2. Distributed Key Generation (DKG)

Bootstrap threshold key generation among multiple parties:
- Participants exchange commitments via encrypted messages
- Share verification happens asynchronously
- Final key shares distributed to all participants
- Entire ceremony verifiable but private

### 3. Secure Multiparty Computation

Enable privacy-preserving computation across parties:
- Input commitments published by each party
- Computation steps coordinated via message passing
- Results revealed only to designated recipients
- Network observers see only encrypted data flow

### 4. Asynchronous Negotiations

Facilitate multi-round negotiations without real-time requirements:
- Parties exchange proposals at their convenience
- Each round builds on previous ARIDs
- State carried in encrypted continuations
- No intermediary servers involved

### 5. Decentralized Messaging

Provide sovereign messaging infrastructure:
- Sender publishes encrypted message at chosen ARID
- Shares ARID with recipient via secure channel (Signal, GSTP, QR code)
- Recipient retrieves and decrypts message (using derived storage key)
- No metadata exposed to network observers (only GSTP envelope structure visible)
